The brand Skittles founded in 1974 by a British Company. At the time
 they were called "Glees". Since then Skittles have become the second most 
 popular candies in America. They have a variety of different fruity
  flavors. Some of these flavors include strawberry, grape, orange, 
  lemon, lime, and green apple. These yummy candies are even 
  acceptable for vegitarian and vegans. They have a chewy center 
  with a crunchy outer shell. No one is quite sure who invented the 
  skittles. Skittles are a very loved candy throughout many places.
